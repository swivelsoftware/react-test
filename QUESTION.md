This is a simple test to check if you have the basic knowledge in HTML, ES6 and React. And of course, you can search from Google for anything you want. 

# Question

You are provided a list of data (a total of 2000 rows) in src/data.js. Please demonstrate how you display the data under the React framework. And please ensure that you are writing formal React code, as well as HTML, CSS and ES6 (without any errors or warnings). 

(Optional) Please make sure the performance of the apllication is fine. Rendering thousands of cells may be slow. 

## in src/data.js

```
headers = [
  {
    key: 'key0',      // key to retrieve the value from data row e.g. data[0].key0
    value: 'Header 1' // display value of this header
  },
  ...
]
data = [
  {...},
  {...},
  ...
]
```
